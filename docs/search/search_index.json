Package Included ros2_intel_realsense ros2_intel_realsense for using Intel\u00ae RealSense\u2122 cameras (D400 series) with ROS2. ros2_object_analytics ros2_object_analytics is a group of ROS2 packages for real-time object detection, localization and tracking. These packages aim to provide real-time object analyses over RGB-D camera inputs, enabling ROS developer to easily create amazing robotics advanced features, like intelligent collision avoidance and semantic SLAM. ros2_openvino_toolkit The OpenVINO\u2122 toolkit quickly deploys applications and solutions that emulate human vision. Based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), the toolkit extends computer vision (CV) workloads across Intel\u00ae hardware, maximizing performance. This project is a ROS2 wrapper for CV API of OpenVINO\u2122, providing the following features: \u2002\u2002 * Support CPU and GPU platforms \u2002\u2002 * Support standard USB camera and Intel\u00ae RealSense\u2122 camera \u2002\u2002 * Support Video or Image file as detection source \u2002\u2002 * Face detection: \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002 Emotion recognition \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002 Age and gender recognition \u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002 Head pose recognition \u2002\u2002 * Object detection \u2002\u2002 * Object segmentation \u2002\u2002 * Demo application to show above detection and recognitions navigation2 The ROS 2 Navigation System is the control system that enables a robot to autonomously reach a goal state, such as a specific position and orientation relative to a specific map. Given a current pose, a map, and a goal, such as a destination pose, the navigation system generates a plan to reach the goal, and outputs commands to autonomously drive the robot, respecting any safety constraints and avoiding obstacles encountered along the way.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"install_instruction/","text":"Intel\u00ae Robot SDK Intel\u00ae Robot SDK is the tool to generate Robotics Software Development Kit (SDK) designed for autonomous devices, including the ROS2 core and capabilities packages like perception, planning, control driver etc. It provides flexible build and runtime configurations to enable several different use cases to be allocated to chosen hardware components.
